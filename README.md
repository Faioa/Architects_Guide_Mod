# Architects_Guide_Mod
A simple mod to help players build multiblocks structures while maintaining a "vanilla" theme.
___
In modpacks and mods in general, it is pretty common to build multiblocks structures while having poor and/or impractical documentation on it. Thus, I wanted to make a mod resolving this issue while staying "vanilla" enough to integrate well in the base game *(not much multiblocks structures, but still...)*.\
\
The idea is to give players the ability to check the materials requirements dynamically, to provide a way to visualize the structures in the world to help building, and also to customize the dimensions of the structures if possible.\
\
I want to make sure it is simple to add custom structure to it.\
Some popular mods will be compatible without any need to configure anything.\
\
Please make a ticket if you find bugs or if you have any suggestion, I'll be sure to read everything and reply as much as possible.\
\
***I plan to only support NeoForge and Fabric.***\

Thank you.
